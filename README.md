# Imperfect Today

This is the Jekyll repo for Imperfect.Today.  It is based off of [pixyll.com](http://www.pixyll.com) but has many of my own changes added.

Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff. It's mobile _first_, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.

It's pretty minimal, but leverages large type and drastic contrast to make a statement, on all devices.

This Pixyl Jekyll theme was crafted with <3 by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com)

The customizations to the theme were done by me :) ([@emcconne](https://twitter.com/emcconne))
